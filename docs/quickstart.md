# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with Spec-Driven Development using Spec Kit.

## The 6-Step Process

### 1. Install Specify CLI

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
specify check
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

### 2. Establish Project Principles

Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. Use the `/speckit.constitution` command to create your project's governing principles:

```bash
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 3. Create the Specification

Use the `/speckit.specify` command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

### 4. Create a Technical Implementation Plan

Use the `/speckit.plan` command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 5. Break Down into Tasks

Use `/speckit.tasks` to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

### 6. Execute Implementation

Use `/speckit.implement` to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

## Detailed Example: Building Taskify

Here's a complete example of building a team productivity platform:

### Step 1: Define Requirements with `/speckit.specify`

```text
Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,
assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,
let's call it "Create Taskify," let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.
I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three
different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as "To Do,"
"In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." There will be no login for this application as this is just the very
first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card,
you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board.
You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task
card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick
from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of
projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns.
You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are
assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly
see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can
delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made.
```

### Step 2: Refine the Specification

After the initial specification is created, clarify any missing requirements:

```text
For each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15
tasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there's at least
one task in each stage of completion.
```

Also validate the specification checklist:

```text
Read the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.
```

### Step 3: Generate Technical Plan with `/speckit.plan`

Be specific about your tech stack and technical requirements:

```text
We are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use
Blazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API,
tasks API, and a notifications API.
```

### Step 4: Validate and Implement

Have your AI agent audit the implementation plan:

```text
Now I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.
Read through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need
to be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here.
```

Finally, implement the solution:

```text
/speckit.implement
```

## Available Slash Commands

After running `specify init`, your AI coding agent will have access to these slash commands:

### Core Commands
- `/speckit.constitution` - Create or update project governing principles
- `/speckit.specify` - Define what you want to build
- `/speckit.plan` - Create technical implementation plans
- `/speckit.tasks` - Generate actionable task lists
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute all tasks to build the feature

### Optional Commands
- `/speckit.clarify` - Clarify underspecified areas
- `/speckit.analyze` - Cross-artifact consistency & coverage analysis
- `/speckit.checklist` - Generate custom quality checklists

## Key Principles

- **Be explicit** about what you're building and why
- **Don't focus on tech stack** during specification phase
- **Iterate and refine** your specifications before implementation
- **Validate** the plan before coding begins
- **Let the AI agent handle** the implementation details
